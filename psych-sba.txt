Introduction

In this module, you will review and apply several concepts from your coursework on behavioral modification. Specifically, you will:

    Read about behavior modification techniques and think about how they apply to a real-life situation.
    Understand the differences between reinforcement and punishment.
    Identify whether behavior modification techniques are positive or negative.

To complete these parts, you will imagine that you are working in a breakout group with classmates named Annie, JJ, and Lin. But keep in mind that this is not an actual breakout group, and these are not real people. They are characters who will help you as you go along. You will also be able to use an AI assistant that is built into this module.

Annie

Hey, sorry I'm late. I was talking to my roommate about a problem.


JJ

What's going on? Is it something you can tell us?


Annie

Oh, yeah, it's not a secret. She's got a babysitting gig for some extra cash,
but the kid is giving her all kinds of trouble, just like his parents warned her.
He's six, and he doesn't want to go to bed. He just runs around when it's his bedtime.


Lin

What did the parents say about it?


Annie

They've tried pretty much everything. They've taken away his games and toys, they've tried to just let him figure it out on his own, but it's almost like nothing will work for them to fix this. She's really frustrated and thinks she should just let him do whatever he wants and hope he'll grow out of it. I told her I was meeting with you all and we would try to come up with something to help her from what we’ve been learning in our psychology class.


Lin

Hey! I read in our textbook that a good way to learn something is to actually use it to solve a problem. We should be able to use what we're learning from psych to come up with a solution for your friend, Annie. We'll also be studying while we’re helping!


Annie

That sounds like a win-win, to me.

JJ

Let's brainstorm some ideas for her. I don't have any kids myself, but I have a younger sister.


Lin

And I've got little cousins.


Annie

Thanks for helping out. She's really stressing about it.

OK, what do YOU think she should do to get the 6-year-old to go to sleep at bedtime???

Annie

Haha, we are all over the place with our ideas!

[[Show list of ideas, including the student's]]

Lin

It looks like the choices are between using behavioral techniques, like we're learning about in class, or doing nothing. My suggestion was to do nothing, but now I'm not sure. I'm going to ask the AI assistant if there's evidence for that.


JJ

My mom’s a Pediatrician, and I have heard her say that not going to bed on time is called "sleep refusal" and the "doing nothing" parenting style is called "no-rules parenting." In Gen Psych, we have been reading about the "permissive" parenting style; "no-rules parenting" seems like an example of that.


Annie

That is definitely NOT how I was raised.


JJ

Same!


Lin

Nope! But we can use "no-rules parenting" and "sleep refusal" in the AI prompt..


JJ

That's a good point. I use AI a lot, and I end up spending a lot of time trying to get my question to it right...otherwise, I get all kinds of weird answers.


Annie

Yeah, I've had that happen too. We should figure out a good way to write the question to get the info we want.

JJ

OK, so if we want to find out about sleep refusal...no-rules parenting...and other ways to get a young child to go to bed...what prompt could we write for the AI?


You

JJ

Ummm ... I asked the question multiple times, and the answer changed.


Annie

That happened to me too! It didn’t change much between searches, but
it changed enough for me to notice. What worries me more is sometimes it gave sources,
but sometimes it didn’t. Then when I tried to look up the sources I was provided, I couldn't
find them all the time!


JJ

One time when I ran it, it gave me evidence AGAINST no-rules parenting,
but it listed it as evidence FOR no-rules parenting.


Lin

I recently read an article that says these are called 'hallucinations'.
They happen because the AI doesn't actually understand what it's saying,
the way a human does. It's more like a parrot than a person. It's just producing
sequences of words it has been trained to produce, in an order determined by a math
formula to look like human speech. It can take wrong turns, and those wrong turns
can spin out of control!

Annie

That means we can't just take the AI summary at face value. We had better
check what it says against the textbook and other sources we can actually
find. You know what, I'll look all of this up and verify everything, then
I'll send you a summary of where I've gotten rid of anything I can't verify.
Then we can go over it together.


JJ

Thanks, Annie! This sounds like a lot of work, but I guess we need to do it
if we want to help your friend!

Lin

Good job, Annie! That's a lot of content. I guess we had better each go over it before we discuss it.

[Activity: Markdown:
"No-rules parenting," or "permissive parenting," is an approach where parents avoid setting firm boundaries and rules, often seeking to be very lenient in their child's behavior, including sleep routines. While this style might seem appealing in some ways, there is limited evidence to support its effectiveness in promoting healthy behaviors like sleep habits. In fact, research generally favors more structured approaches to sleep and behavior management. Below is the evidence regarding no-rules parenting and alternatives for addressing sleep refusal.

Evidence For and Against No-Rules Parenting to Address Sleep Refusal

    Child-Led Autonomy
        Claim: Allowing children to choose when to sleep can foster autonomy, reducing bedtime power struggles and increasing intrinsic motivation to rest.
        Evidence and Counterevidence:
            Studies on self-determination theory suggest that giving children choices promotes a sense of control, potentially reducing defiance.
            However, young children often lack the biological and cognitive maturity to make health-conscious decisions about sleep. Sleep research shows that inconsistent schedules can disrupt circadian rhythms, leading to insufficient or fragmented sleep.
]


JJ

This research is amazing!

[Activity: Markdown:

    Natural Consequences
        Claim: Experiencing the effects of insufficient sleep (e.g., feeling tired) could motivate a child to adjust bedtime without external pressure.
        Evidence and CounterEvidence:
            Natural consequences are more effective for older children and adolescents who can connect cause and effect.
            However, younger children may not link fatigue with staying up late and could experience negative effects like irritability, reduced focus, and weakened immune function.
    Reduced Stress Around Sleep
        Claim: Removing strict bedtime rules may create a relaxed environment, making it easier for children to fall asleep naturally.
        Evidence and Counterevidence:
            Stress and anxiety are known to interfere with sleep onset.
            However, research suggests that structured bedtime routines reduce cortisol levels and promote melatonin release, facilitating better sleep.
]
Annie

It is a lot. I actually had to ask the question several different ways to get all of the information I found. Sometimes small differences in the way I asked the question got me a very different answer.


JJ

So much for "do nothing" lol. It seems like there's a lot more evidence against no-rules parenting than for it.

[Activity: Markdown:

    Parental Responsiveness
        Claim: Prioritizing connection and meeting the child's needs (e.g., through co-sleeping or comforting) can improve emotional security, reducing sleep resistance.
        Evidence and Counterevidence:
            Attachment-based approaches can improve sleep quality by addressing underlying anxieties or fears.
            However, overly permissive approaches without structure may inadvertently reinforce avoidance behaviors.

Challenges of No-Rules Parenting for Sleep Refusal

    Inconsistent Sleep Patterns: A lack of structure can lead to irregular sleep, which is associated with behavioral and cognitive challenges.
    Delayed Sleep Onset: Without a set bedtime, children may stay awake longer, disrupting their natural sleep-wake cycles.
    Parental Burnout: Allowing children to dictate bedtime can result in extended negotiations and increased nighttime disruptions.

Lin

I agree with JJ. Annie, since your friend is about ready to give up, maybe we should put together an email that explains why giving up and going with no-rules parenting (and no bedtime) would be a bad idea.


Annie

All right. Once we write that, we can look into what we have learned about effective methods to set a consistent bedtime, and add that to our email.

To make sure that our email is really good, let's get some feedback from AI. If we need to improve our email, we can go back and change the text, then get more feedback.


Lin

Here's the prompt I wrote for us to try to get feedback from AI. It took a bit of work to make it precise enough to give us targeted feedback:

Here is an email I wrote to explain to a friend why they need to avoid a no-rules parenting approach and find a good strategy to get a six-year-old child to bed on time.

Briefly, in no more than two or three sentences, evaluate how well I have used evidence from psychology to support this argument (but restricting that feedback to feedback that is appropriate given the purpose of the email).

Annie

All right, I think we've covered no-rules parenting. But our email really needs to give my friend a practical solution -- one we know will work, because there's good psychological evidence for it. So I also dug into information about strategies we could suggest to her, so she can solve that bedtime problem!

There’s only one issue. I have seven different ideas for how to address sleep refusal. Which is a lot!


Lin

Well, I know which one I like! Why don't we take a poll and see which of these choices we think we should recommend?

[Activity: MCQ

Which one of these possible strategies should we recommend to Annie's friend?

    Collaborative Problem Solving

Annie

Well ... since it seems like we can’t agree on what to recommend, maybe we should take a closer look at the notes I put together about each strategy.

[Activity: Markdown

Alternatives to Address Sleep Refusal

Evidence-based strategies balance autonomy with structure, helping children feel both empowered and guided:

    Flexible Bedtime Routines
        What It Is: Establish a routine with consistent elements (e.g., bath, story, lights out) while allowing minor variations, like choosing the story or bedtime music.
        Why It Works: Predictable routines help regulate circadian rhythms, and offering small choices fosters autonomy.
        Evidence: Research consistently supports bedtime routines as critical for improving sleep duration and quality in children.
    Positive Reinforcement
        What It Is: Rewarding bedtime compliance with incentives like stickers, extra story time, or praise.
        Why It Works: Reinforcement encourages desired behaviors while minimizing resistance.
        Evidence: Behavioral interventions, including reward systems, are shown to be effective in managing sleep refusal.
]


JJ

Hey Annie, do you know if your friend's child gets scared or anxious when bedtime approaches? I hadn't even thought about the need for empathy and emotional support.


Annie

I don't know. I'll have to ask her.

[Activity: Markdown

    Gradual Fading
        What It Is: Gradually adjusting bedtime to an earlier time, aligning it with the child's natural sleep patterns.
        Why It Works: This reduces resistance by aligning with the child's internal clock while transitioning to a more structured bedtime.
        Evidence: Studies on bedtime fading highlight its effectiveness in addressing sleep resistance and promoting earlier sleep onset.
    Empathy and Emotional Support
        What It Is: Addressing fears, anxieties, or unmet needs that might underlie sleep refusal.
        Why It Works: Understanding the root cause helps resolve emotional blocks to sleep.
        Evidence: Emotion-focused approaches, such as validating feelings or using comfort objects, improve sleep in children with separation anxiety or fear of the dark.
]


JJ

Woah! There’s honestly a lot of good strategies she could try, and we haven’t even covered them all yet.

[Activity: Markdown

    Natural Consequences with Limits
        What It Is: Allowing some flexibility in bedtime while enforcing non-negotiable wake-up times to teach self-regulation.
        Why It Works: Balances autonomy with accountability, helping older children connect choices with outcomes.
        Evidence: Works best with children who can understand cause and effect.
    Environmental Adjustments
        What It Is: Optimizing the sleep environment with dim lighting, white noise, or calming activities like reading.
        Why It Works: Creates a sensory atmosphere conducive to sleep without relying on strict enforcement.
        Evidence: Environmental adjustments have been shown to improve sleep quality in both children and adults.]


Lin

Wow, Annie. There's so much information here, I'm not sure how to explain it to your friend or what she could even do with it.


Annie

Yeah. I think we're going to have to figure out which of these is the best thing for her to try and explain that!

[Activity: Markdown

    Collaborative Problem-Solving
        What It Is: Working with the child to identify and address barriers to sleep (e.g., fears, overstimulation).
        Why It Works: Encourages the child to take ownership of the solution while feeling supported.
        Evidence: Collaborative approaches reduce resistance and build problem-solving skills.

Conclusion

While no-rules parenting may appeal to families seeking to avoid power struggles, its effectiveness for addressing sleep refusal is limited, especially in younger children. Structured, evidence-based alternatives--such as flexible routines, positive reinforcement, and gradual fading--are more consistently effective at promoting healthy sleep while respecting a child's autonomy.
]

Lin

OK, so now that we know what the strategies are, we can figure out which of them is the best choice for your roommate to use, Annie. But how should we go about doing that?


JJ

Well, not all of the strategies will apply to a six-year-old. We should eliminate any that seem unlikely to work with younger children.


Annie

Also, some of the strategies might work better for the parents, because they're around all the time. We need a strategy Annie's friend can use even if it doesn't line up with what the parents are doing.


Lin

There's another thing to think about. Annie's friend needs fast results! We shouldn't advise her to try anything that would take a long time, or only make small changes to the child's behavior.


Annie

That makes sense! So let's take it step by step, and see which of the strategies we can eliminate using one of these criteria.


Annie

Let's start by checking whether any of these strategies aren't likely to work on younger children. Even if we only eliminate one of the seven, it'll be a start.

OK, I've put together this table to show what we decided for each strategy based on the majority of our votes.

Incidentally, some of us got a response from the AI that said collaborative problem solving wasn't completely feasible, because it requires intimate knowledge, trust, and an ongoing relationship. But I think my friend has that kind of relationship, so I've marked "collaborative problem solving" as feasible.

JJ

That means we've narrowed down our choices to three:

    Positive Reinforcement
    Empathy and Emotional Support
    Collaborative Problem Solving


Lin

Well, I guess we need to figure out which of these techniques works best. I remember from my psychology course that these strategies are called "parenting techniques", and if you want to know how effective they are, you look into their "effect size".


Annie

Let's take a break then, and each of us do some research. Let's see what we can come up with!

JJ

I asked ChatGPT: "What are the short-term effect sizes for the following parenting techniques: positive reinforcement, empathy and emotional support, and collaborative problem solving?"

When I ran it a few times, it consistently said positive reinforcement has moderate to large  effect sizes, empathy and emotional support have moderate effect sizes, and collaborative problem solving has small to moderate effect sizes.

If we're going with this, we should probably recommend that Annie's friend try positive reinforcement to solve the kid's bedtime problem.


Lin

Well, when I tried to get sources from the AI, they weren't helpful. So I went to Google Scholar instead because that's a great place to look for research articles. At first a lot of the results were irrelevant, but I finally had some luck when I typed in the following search:

What are the effect sizes for parenting techniques?

Look at the article that was at the top of the search!

[What to teach parents to reduce disruptive child behavior: two meta-analyses of parenting program components](https://www.jaacap.org/action/showPdf?pii=S0890-8567%2818%2931980-4)

It actually looks at both long-term and short-term effects. When I dug into the details, I found a table that showed a larger absolute effect size for positive reinforcement reducing problem behaviors than for empathy and problem-solving!


Annie

I thought I would go old-school and simply use the subject index at the back of the textbook!

At first, the results were frustrating. The entries for "positive reinforcement" didn't say anything about how effective it was, compared to anything else. Looking up emotion and empathy didn't lead me to anything useful, and I couldn't even find "collaborative problem solving" in the index.

But then I looked for "parenting techniques". I found a section labeled, "Parent-child relationship", and under that there was an entry, "operant conditioning, and". The "operant condiopning, and" part really means, "operant conditioning and the parent-child relationship". I remembered from when we were studying operant conditioning that it works through positive (and also negative reinforcement), so I figured it was a good place to look, especially since I couldn't find anything else that was relevant. Here's what the textbook says, on page 243:

As we have seen, parents can learn from operant conditioning practices ... parents should remember the basic rule of shaping: Notice people doing something right and affirm them for it. Give children attention and other reinforcers when they are behaving well .... Target a specific behavior, reward it, and watch it increase. When children misbehave, don't yell at them or hit them. Simply explain the misbehavior and take away the screen time, remove a misused toy, or give a brief time-out.

Since operant conditioning (and hence positive and negative reinforcement) is pretty much the only advice the book gives about childhood misbehavior, I think that confirms it. Positive reinforcement is what we should recommend!

JJ

Don't you think this is where we can bring in the things we're studying in Psych class? Here are my lecture notes... I've got a definition of "reinforcement." It's from our textbook.

[Activity: Markdown, preferably in handwriting font

Lecture Notes:

Definition of Reinforcement: Reinforcement is any event that strengthens (increases the frequency of) a preceding response.

Examples:

    Charlotte shares her crayons with classmates because it earns her positive attention from peers.
    Sofia screams in the grocery store until her parent gives her candy.
    Benjamin plays nicely with others because he gets extra playtime when he shares.
    Daniel whines loudly whenever his caregiver focuses on another child.
]

Lin

I'm not quite sure I get this. In the class, we learned about both positive and negative reinforcement. Isn't that basically just reward vs. punishment?


JJ

Uh, no ... punishment isn't the same thing as negative reinforcement. Let me look up my notes.


JJ

Here we go. Here's how my notes say punishment is defined.

[Activity: Markdown

Lecture Notes:

Definition of Punishment: Punishment is any consequence that decreases the frequency of a preceding behavior.

Examples:

Liam stops throwing toys after being told firmly that it's unacceptable.
Amelia avoids asking questions in class because she once received an impatient response from her teacher.
Nathan follows classroom rules after being sent to the principal's office for breaking them.
Ella withdraws from group activities because her peers laughed at her during a presentation.
]

Annie

Looking at the examples confuses me a little. It seems to include unintentional consequences! I mean, in the second example, Amelia's teacher wasn't trying to punish her.


Lin

Reinforcement and punishment are being used as technical terms. Anything that makes a preceding behavior more likely is a reinforcement. Anything that makes it less likely is a punishment.


JJ

I'm still a bit confused. Why are the examples with Ella and Nathan classified as punishment instead of reinforcement?

JJ

It sounds like we may still be a bit confused on these concepts. I don't think we should give Annie's friend any advice until we're sure we know exactly what positive reinforcement is!


Lin

You're right!

Hey, everyone, I've got an idea.

Do you remember when the TA gave us that practice quiz handout with twenty extra questions on it to help us practice telling the difference between reinforcement and punishment? Why don’t we try to answer those questions? Then, we can discuss them ...

Here are the answers to the first five questions.
[Statement	Reinforcement	Punishment
1. Liam reads a book every night because he earns a sticker for each completed book.	✔ 
	
2. Daniel puts away his toys so his parents will stop asking him to clean up.	✔ 
	
3. Lucas stops touching the hot stove after he accidentally burns his hand.	
	✔ 
4. Nicole avoids showing her homework to her parents because they reduce her screen time when it's incomplete.	
	✔ 
5. Victoria throws a tantrum at dinner to get out of eating her vegetables.	✔ ]
JJ

I got #3 wrong. I was confused by "accidentally". It didn't matter if it was an accident. It reduced the likelihood that Lucas would touch the stove to zero, so in terms of psychological theory, it was a punishment.

Lin

Here are the answers to questions six through ten on the quiz. Looks like these are all examples of reinforcement!

[Statement	Reinforcement	Punishment
6. Mia whines at the store because her parents give her candy to quiet her.	✔ 
	
7. Matthew makes his bed every morning so his mom doesn't get upset.	✔ 
	
8. Noah practices the piano daily because his parents cheer him on after each session.	✔ 
	
9. Layla scribbles on walls because her sibling laughs and calls her "an artist."	✔ 
	
10. William follows playground rules so he doesn't lose recess time.	✔ ]

Annie

#7 confused me. But I guess you can paraphrase it as "Whenever his mom gets upset, that makes Matthew more likely to make his bed in the morning," so it's a reinforcer.


JJ

#9 confused me because the sister is probably calling her an artist to be sarcastic. She wants her to stop! But the sarcastic praise is still making her more likely to scribble on the walls, so it's a reinforcer.

Lin

Here are the answers to questions eleven through fifteen on the quiz.

[Statement	Reinforcement	Punishment
11. Michael stays seated during meals after his father frowns and glares at him every time he stands up.	
	✔ 
12. Luna stops asking questions in class because her teacher never calls on her to speak.	
	✔ 
13. Benjamin stops throwing toys after being told firmly that it's unacceptable.	
	✔ 
14. Nathan stops interrupting when his teacher starts making him sit in a "quiet corner."	
	✔ 
15. Jackson doesn't try new foods because his favorite dessert was once removed for refusing broccoli.	
	✔ ]

JJ

#12 confused me because I didn't think NOT doing something would count as punishment. But her teacher never calling on her to speak made it less likely that Luna would ask questions in class, so it counts as punishment.


Annie

#15 confused me, because dessert was taken away only once. But that one time had a big impact, and took the probability that Jackson will try new foods down to zero, so it counts as punishment psychologically.


Lin

#11 confused me, because the dad's actions are making it MORE likely that Michael will stay seated. But what's really happening is that the dad is frowning angrily when Michael stands up, and that's making Michael less likely to stand. So it's also a punishment.

Lin

Here are the answers to questions sixteen through twenty on the quiz.

[Statement	Reinforcement	Punishment
16. Charlotte organizes her desk because she earns a "Super Organized" badge from her teacher for doing so.	✔ 
	
17. Aiden studies for tests to avoid being grounded for poor grades.	✔ 
	
18. Jack refuses to put on his shoes until his parent offers a snack as a bribe.	✔ 
	
19. Chloe stops playing with scissors after being told by her teacher.	
	✔ 
20. Amelia stops participating in group activities after being excluded as punishment in the past.	
	✔ ]

Lin

Here are the answers to questions sixteen through twenty on the quiz.


Annie

#19 confused me, because the teacher giving Chloe an order didn't seem like a punishment to me! But it counts as one, because it made Chloe less likely to play with scissors.


JJ

#17 confused me, because it sure sounded like a punishment if she got grounded! But grounding her made her study more, so it's a reinforcement, the way psychologists think about it. If it increases the likelihood someone does something, psychologists call it reinforcement, and if it decreases the likelihood, psychologists call it punishment.


Lin

I think we're getting a lot closer to helping your roommate out, Annie, but can you text her to see what she and the parents have been doing recently to try to get the kid to go to bed?


JJ

Good idea. We know it was sometimes "do nothing," but maybe not every time.


Annie

Sure, I’ll text her now and let you know what she says.


Annie

She texted right back. See for yourselves.

[TODO: Picture of a conversation. Need to convert here]


Lin

So what is this? Punishment or reinforcement?


JJ

You'd think yelling was punishment! But it doesn't seem to have worked as punishment, because his refusing to go to sleep got worse. So in this case, yelling was a reinforcer. If yelling worked as a punisher, we would expect that he would stop the problem behaviors after being yelled at.


Annie

In other words, their attempt to control his behavior gave him something he wanted, probably attention, so every time they tried to bring the problem under control, they were only making it worse.


Lin

That means we need to figure out things to suggest that will reinforce cooperation. We don't want to accidentally reinforce the wrong thing!

Annie

Hey guys, there's still something we need to get clear in our own heads before we offer any solutions to my roommate. The most effective behavior modification technique, according to what we learned earlier, is positive  reinforcement. But I'm not really clear yet on the difference between positive and negative reinforcement.


JJ

I just checked back through my notes ... here's what I have:

[Activity: Markdown:

Lecture Notes:

Positive reinforcement strengthens responding by presenting a typically pleasurable stimulus immediately after a response.

Negative reinforcement strengthens a response by reducing or removing a typically unpleasant stimulus immediately after a response.
]


JJ

So, positive doesn't mean good, and negative doesn't mean bad. Instead, positive means adding something, and negative means taking something away! And it's the same for punishment. Look! Here's what I have in my notes::


Lin

So positive punishment would be like spanking the child every time he tries to avoid bedtime. The adult is adding spanking, something that is undesirable, to decrease the child’s behavior of avoiding bedtime.


Annie

And negative punishment would be like taking away his favorite toy whenever he avoids bedtime. The adult is taking away the toy, something desirable, to decrease the child’s behavior of avoiding bedtime.


JJ

I'm still not as clear on this as I would like to be. Maybe some practice would help!

Can we take some of the things that the parents have already tried or that we suggested early on and figure out what category they fit into? I don't know about you, but that would help me.


Annie

Yeah...me, too. How about if we fill in something like this graphic?

[Activity: Drag-and-drop table

How should the following statements be classified?
Drag and drop each choice below into the correct table cell above.
Positive Reinforcement	Negative Reinforcement

Giving the child a sticker of his favorite cartoon character when he goes to bed when asked.
Taking away his electronics for a week after he refuses to go to bed 3 times.
Making the child write 'I will go to sleep on time' 100 times if he does not go to bed when asked.
Allowing the child to have a pass on their chores when they go to bed when asked.

Lin

Hey everyone -- the TA just told me the quiz we took is a simplified version of the full quiz he gave in past years.

Let's try the full version of the quiz, where we have to decide not only if something is reinforcement or punishment, but if it's positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment, or negative punishment.


JJ

I'm game.


Annie

I am, too. Let's give it a try!

Lin

Here are the first five questions on the quiz.
