## Abstract

This study examines high school dropout rates in rural and urban areas, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) from 1979 and 1997. The findings suggest that high school graduation rates are similar across rural and urban areas, with a slight decline in graduation rates over time. Key determinants of graduation include gender, family assets, presence of biological parents, and maternal attributes, which influence graduation similarly across both rural and urban areas.

## Introduction

A prevalent perception is that school dropout is an urban problem. However, it is unclear whether or not school dropout rates are different in urban and rural environments. The study explores the importance of high school graduation for economic and social outcomes. It investigates whether rural and urban areas differ in high school dropout rates and the factors influencing these rates, considering recent changes in rural-urban boundaries and socioeconomic conditions.

## Method

The study uses geocoded data from the NLSY79 and NLSY97, applying a methodology that corrects for biases in graduation rates. It defines graduates according to Heckman and LaFontaine (2010), excluding GED recipients and including military and prison populations. The analysis includes probit models to estimate dropout risks and examines changes over time.

## Results

### Dropout Rates

Graduation rates are similar across rural and urban areas, with a 3 percentage point decline from the 1980s to the 2000s. Rural areas experienced a smaller increase in dropout rates compared to urban areas.

### Determinants

Key factors influencing graduation include gender, family assets, presence of biological parents, and maternal education. These factors have similar effects across rural and urban areas. Peer characteristics, such as gang involvement and drug use, also influence dropout rates, with some differences between urban and rural areas.

## Discussion

The study highlights that family characteristics are more predictive of graduation than geographic attributes. Differences in dropout rates between rural and urban areas are small and narrowing. The findings suggest that policies should focus on family support and peer influences to reduce dropout rates.

## Conclusion

High school dropout rates are similar across rural and urban areas, with family characteristics being the main determinants of graduation. The study emphasizes the importance of addressing family and peer influences to improve graduation rates and reduce dropouts.
