## From 'An Open Letter to the American People'

A primary purpose of this report is to approach the dropout problem from a perspective that has not been much considered in past studies -- that of the students themselves. These efforts were designed to paint a more in-depth picture of who these young people are, why they dropped out of high school, and what might have helped them complete their high school education. We wanted to give their stories and insights a voice, and to offer our own views on next steps, in the hope that this report could be a further wake-up call to educators, policymakers, other leaders, and the public to summon the national will to address the high school dropout epidemic.

This report underscores that most high school dropouts are not students struggling academically but are individuals who genuinely believed they could have been successful in their educational pursuits. Our survey findings highlight that several external circumstances and the lack of a proper response from educational institutions precipitate the decision to abandon school. These reasons for discontinuing education are universally applicable, regardless of the students' geographical location.

## From the Executive Summary

The central message of this report is that while some students drop out because of significant academic challenges, most dropouts are students who could have, and believe they could have, succeeded in school. This survey of young people who left high school without graduating suggests that, despite career aspirations that require education beyond high school and a majority having grades of a C or better, circumstances in students' lives and an inadequate response to those circumstances from the schools led to dropping out. While reasons vary, the general categories remain the same, whether in inner city Los Angeles or suburban Nebraska.

There is no single reason why students drop out of high school. Respondents report different reasons: a lack of connection to the school environment; a perception that school is boring; feeling unmotivated; academic challenges; and the weight of real world events. But indications are strong that these barriers to graduation are not insurmountable.

## Key Findings from Student Perspectives

### Engagement and Motivation

- **Nearly half (47 percent) said a major reason for dropping out was that classes were not interesting.** These young people reported being bored and disengaged from high school. Almost as many (42 percent) spent time with people who were not interested in school. These were among the top reasons selected by those with high GPAs and by those who said they were motivated to work hard.

- **Nearly 7 in 10 respondents (69 percent) said they were not motivated or inspired to work hard,** 80 percent did one hour or less of homework each day in high school, two-thirds would have worked harder if more was demanded of them (higher academic standards and more studying and homework), and 70 percent were confident they could have graduated if they had tried. Even a majority of those with low GPAs thought they could have graduated.

### Personal and Economic Reasons

- **Many students gave personal reasons for leaving school.** A third (32 percent) said they had to get a job and make money; 26 percent said they became a parent; and 22 percent said they had to care for a family member. Many of these young people reported doing reasonably well in school and had a strong belief that they could have graduated if they had stayed in school. These students also were the most likely to say they would have worked harder if their schools had demanded more of them and provided the necessary support.

### Academic Challenges

**It is clear that some dropouts, but not the majority, leave school because of significant academic challenges.**

- **Thirty-five percent said that "failing in school" was a major factor for dropping out;** three out of ten said they could not keep up with schoolwork; and 43 percent said they missed too many days of school and could not catch up.

- **Forty-five percent said they started high school poorly prepared by their earlier schooling.** Many of these students likely fell behind in elementary and middle school and could not make up the necessary ground. They reported that additional supports in high school that would have made a difference (such as tutoring or after school help) were not there.

- **Thirty-two percent were required to repeat a grade before dropping out** and twenty-nine percent expressed significant doubts that they could have met their high school's requirements for graduation even if they had put in the necessary effort. The most academically challenged students were the most likely to report that their schools were not doing enough to help students when they had trouble learning and to express doubt about whether they would have worked harder if more had been expected of them.
