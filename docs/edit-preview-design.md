# Edit Page & Live Preview Design Options

This document outlines approaches to fix the broken edit page and support
editing OLX and auxiliary files (e.g. `.chatpeg`) with a live preview.

## Current state

The preview pane parses the edited file with `parseOLX` and merges the
result with the global `idMap` fetched from `/api/content/all`.
`parseOLX` now supports an optional storage provider and asynchronous
operations, but the edit page still calls it without a provider:

```ts
candidate = await parseOLX(content, prov);
```
(see `src/app/edit/[[...path]]/page.tsx` lines 206–211)

This means blocks like `<Chat src="sba.chatpeg"/>` cannot load their
external content.  The `/api/file` route also rejects non‐XML files,
blocking edits of `.chatpeg` scripts:

```ts
if (!full.endsWith('.xml') && !full.endsWith('.olx')) {
  throw new Error('Invalid file type');
}
```
(from `src/app/api/file/route.js` lines 23–26)

## Goals
- Allow authors to edit XML/OLX files and related assets (`.chatpeg`, etc.)
- Show a preview that reflects unsaved edits across all referenced files
- Keep the interface responsive (re-render on change)

## Proposed building blocks

### 1. Storage provider overlay
The editor runs in the browser while `FileStorageProvider` only exists on
the server.  We therefore introduce a `NetworkStorageProvider` that
proxies read/write requests to `/api/file`.  In memory edits live in a
`ReduxStorageProvider`.  These providers are stacked using an
`overlayProviders` helper so each call checks the overlays in order.

```ts
const provider = overlayProviders(
  new ReduxStorageProvider(reduxState),
  new NetworkStorageProvider('/api/file')
);
```

The resulting provider implements the same interface as `StorageProvider`:
- look up unsaved edits from Redux using the path as key
- fall back to the network (and ultimately the filesystem) when no
  override exists
- expose the usual `read`, `write` and `update` methods

With this stack `parseOLX` can load referenced sources from in-memory or
server storage transparently.

### 2. Passing the provider to the preview
`PreviewPane` should create a provider stack each time content or related
state changes:
```ts
const provider = overlayProviders(
  new ReduxStorageProvider(reduxState),
  new NetworkStorageProvider('/api/file')
);
const prov = path ? [`file://${path}`] : [];
const candidate = await parseOLX(content, prov, provider);
```
Updating this call ensures `<Chat src="..."/>` resolves correctly and
lets the preview use the latest unsaved edits.

### 3. Relax file type checks
`/api/file` currently only allows `.xml` and `.olx` files.  Auxiliary
formats such as `.chatpeg` should also be editable.  The allowed list of
extensions can be generated from the available PEG grammars (e.g. via
`npm run build:grammars`) so the route stays declarative and easy to
extend.  The handler then rejects anything not in the known set so we
still avoid random binary uploads.

### 4. Choosing what to preview
There is rarely a one‑to‑one mapping between the file being edited and
the rendered output.  A `.chatpeg` script may appear in many OLX files or
even multiple times within the same document.  Two strategies surfaced
during discussion:

1. **Explicit preview target** – the URL or an on‑page drop‑down lists
   all OLX provenances that reference the current file.  The first entry
   becomes the default preview, but authors can switch to another
   reference.
2. **Automatic detection** – build a reverse index from the global
   `idMap` so the preview can pick a parent automatically when only one
   exists.  If multiple parents reference the element the UI still shows
   the drop‑down from option 1.

Both approaches rely on `parseOLX` with the overlaid provider stack so
preview always uses the latest in-memory content.

### 5. Triggering re-render
`ReduxStorageProvider` can emit a custom event or update Redux state
whenever a file changes.  The preview pane subscribes to these changes
(via a React hook) and re-runs `parseOLX` for the preview target.  This
keeps the UI responsive without polling.

### 6. Saving and provenance
Saving pushes content down the provider stack.  `ReduxStorageProvider`
stores the most recent edits in memory and exposes `write`/`update` that
forward the request to the next provider (here the network layer).  The
server in turn persists to the user's git repo or another backing store.
Each layer appends its own string to a provenance array so the graph can
track where content originated (`redux:`, `network:`, `file:` and so on).
Most edits will only involve the top two providers (redux → git).  More
complex setups could insert institutional or shared sources below, but
the data structure simply records the chain as it is executed.  When the
user hits "save" each provider in the stack executes sequentially and
updates the corresponding provenances.

### 7. Loading state
Parsing and network requests are asynchronous.  The preview pane should
display a loading indicator (or skeleton) while waiting for
`parseOLX` to resolve.  The provider can expose a simple `onStart`/`onEnd`
callback that increments a "pending" counter in Redux; when the counter is
non‑zero the UI shows a spinner so authors know the preview is still
processing.

## Recommendation
Start with the explicit preview target (#4 option 1) and the storage
provider overlay.  They introduce minimal complexity and unblock author
workflows.  Automatic parent detection and richer collaboration features
can be layered on later.
