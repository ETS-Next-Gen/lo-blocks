## Abstract

This study examines whether working long hours during high school is still a risk factor for dropping out. Using data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, the authors found that intensive work (more than 20 hours per week) is still linked to higher dropout rates and lower grades. Despite fewer teens working long hours today, disadvantaged youth are still overrepresented among those who work intensively and drop out.

## Introduction

Understanding why students choose to drop out is critical for finding ways to support students' decision to stay in school. There has been some speculation that students feel economic pressures that lead them to decide to drop out of school. In fact, past research has shown that working long hours during high school increases the risk of dropping out. This study revisits this issue using recent data, considering changes in the labor market and educational landscape.

## Method

The study uses data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, which surveyed ninth graders in 2009 and followed them through high school. The sample includes 25,210 students, with data on their employment, academic performance, and family background.

## Results

### Employment Trends

Only 11% of students worked more than 20 hours per week during the school year.

### Dropout Rates

Intensive workers had a 44% higher chance of dropping out compared to non-workers, even after controlling for other factors.

### Grades

Intensive workers had significantly lower GPAs compared to non-workers and moderate workers.

## Discussion

Intensive work during high school remains a risk factor for poor academic outcomes and dropout. The study suggests that schools should provide more support and flexibility for students who need to work long hours.

## Conclusion

Despite changes in the labor market, working long hours during high school is still associated with higher dropout rates and lower academic performance. Policies should address the needs of working students to help them stay in school and succeed academically.
