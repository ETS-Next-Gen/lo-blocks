## Abstract

This study examines the relationship between heavy and persistent marijuana use and high school dropout status. Using a prospective panel study of over 4500 7th grade students from South Dakota, the authors developed propensity score weights to adjust for baseline differences before marijuana initiation. The study found a positive association between marijuana use and dropping out, but over half of this association was explained by prior differences in observational characteristics and behaviors. The remaining association became statistically insignificant when measures of cigarette smoking were included, suggesting that the relationship is unlikely due to marijuana's cognitive effects but rather to other factors such as peer influences.

## Introduction

High school dropout is a persistent problem in the United States. While there are a variety of reasons students drop out, health-related decisions such as casual drug use may contribute to this problem. The study explores the relationship between marijuana use and educational attainment, examining whether marijuana use causally affects cognitive functioning and school outcomes. It uses propensity score methods to minimize selection bias and evaluates time-varying factors influencing dropout rates.

## Method

The study uses data from the ALERT and ALERT Plus drug prevention programs, following 7th grade students through high school. Propensity score weights were developed to create observationally equivalent groups of marijuana users and nonusers. Logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of marijuana use on dropout status, accounting for various baseline and time-varying factors.

## Results

### Dropout Rates

Marijuana users are more likely to drop out of high school, but this association is significantly reduced when accounting for baseline differences.

### Cigarette Smoking

Including measures of cigarette smoking in the analysis further reduces the association between marijuana use and dropout, suggesting that the relationship is not due to marijuana's cognitive effects.

### Other Factors

Time-varying parental and peer influences, rather than cognitive impairment, appear to drive the association between marijuana use and dropout.

## Discussion

The study highlights the importance of considering selection bias and time-varying factors when examining the relationship between marijuana use and educational outcomes. The findings suggest that interventions should focus on addressing peer and family influences rather than solely targeting marijuana use.

## Conclusion

The association between marijuana use and high school dropout is largely explained by pre-existing differences and other factors such as peer influences. The study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying this relationship and suggests directions for future research and interventions.
