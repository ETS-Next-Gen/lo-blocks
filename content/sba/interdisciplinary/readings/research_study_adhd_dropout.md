## Abstract

This study examines whether ADHD increases the likelihood of grade retention and high school dropout, even when accounting for IQ, learning disorders, and social class. The study involved 404 individuals with ADHD and 349 controls. Results showed that 28% of those with ADHD repeated a grade compared to 7% of controls. Social class and IQ were significant predictors of dropout or grade retention, with females with ADHD at higher risk than males. Early identification and intervention for ADHD are crucial to prevent these negative educational outcomes.

## Introduction

Each year, many students in the U.S. fail to graduate high school on time, leading to negative life outcomes. Grade retention is also a significant predictor of high school dropout. Identifying psychological risk factors, such as ADHD, is important for intervention efforts.

## Background

ADHD is consistently linked to educational deficits, including school failure, poor grades, and grade retention. Previous studies have shown that ADHD increases the risk of dropping out of high school.

## Method

The study used data from three large case-control studies at Massachusetts General Hospital. Participants included boys and girls with and without ADHD, as well as adults. Psychiatric interviews, socioeconomic status measures, and IQ tests were conducted.

## Results

Participants with ADHD were significantly more likely to repeat a grade or drop out of high school compared to controls. Females with ADHD had a higher risk of grade retention/dropout than males. Social class and IQ were also significant predictors.

## Discussion

ADHD is a significant risk factor for grade retention and high school dropout, independent of other factors like IQ and social class. Early identification and intervention are critical to mitigate these risks. The study highlights the importance of addressing ADHD to improve educational outcomes.

## Conclusion

ADHD significantly contributes to grade retention and high school dropout. Early screening and intervention can help prevent these negative outcomes, benefiting individuals, families, and society.
