    ## Navigator with Child Blocks Demo
    
    This demonstrates the new Navigator component using actual child blocks as preview and detail components,
    rather than hardcoded component types.
  </TextBlock>

  <Navigator id="team_navigator_blocks"
             title="Team Members"
             preview="TeamPreview"
             detail="TeamDetail">

    ## How This Works
    
    - **Navigator** component uses `data` attribute for YAML content
    - **NavigatorPreview** and **NavigatorDetail** are child blocks that define the UI
    - Each gets `itemData` passed as context with the current item's data
    - Uses template syntax `{{itemData.name}}` to display dynamic content
    - Child blocks can be any Learning Observer blocks (TextBlock, TextArea, etc.)
    - Each team member's notes get unique IDs like `notes_about_ty`
  </TextBlock>

    ## Benefits of Block-Based Approach
    
    - **Reusable**: Any block can be used as preview/detail
    - **Flexible**: Mix text, inputs, images, etc. in custom layouts
    - **Composable**: Follows Learning Observer's component philosophy
    - **Powerful**: Each item can have its own interactive elements
    - **Analytics**: All interactions are tracked via lo_event system
