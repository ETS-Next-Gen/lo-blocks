## Executive Summary

High school dropout is a critical national issue with deep economic and social consequences. This report provides updated statistics showing that about 10% of U.S. students aged 16-24 drop out, impacting their earnings and increasing reliance on public assistance.

Dropouts face economic hardships, higher unemployment, and are more likely to engage in crime. Their lower income potential also increases public spending on healthcare, welfare, and criminal justice.

## Recommendations

- Implement early intervention programs.
- Promote alternative education pathways like vocational training.
- Strengthen community-school partnerships to support at-risk students.

## Conclusion

Addressing the dropout rate requires a collective effort from all societal stakeholders to enhance educational outcomes and societal well-being.
